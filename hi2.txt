In the hush of dawn, the world awakes anew,
A gentle golden shimmer paints the sky’s soft blue.
Whispers of the morning breeze caress the sleeping trees,
And every leaf and petal stirs with hope upon the breeze.

The city yawns and stretches, shaking off the night,
Windows glow with promise, hearts are filled with light.
Children’s laughter bubbles, echoing down the lane,
A melody of innocence, untouched by sorrow’s stain.

The river hums a ballad, winding through the land,
Carrying dreams and secrets, written in the sand.
Mountains stand as guardians, ancient, wise, and tall,
Their silent strength a comfort, a refuge for us all.

Birds compose a symphony, a chorus in the air,
Each note a tiny miracle, a song beyond compare.
Flowers lift their faces, painted bright and bold,
Stories told in color, in crimson, blue, and gold.

As sunlight dances softly on fields of emerald green,
The world becomes a canvas, a living, breathing scene.
We walk the path of wonder, beneath the endless dome,
Finding in each moment, the poetry of home.

So let us greet the morning, with gratitude and grace,
For every day’s a blessing, in this wondrous place.
